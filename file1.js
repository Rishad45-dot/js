 * != this one also doesn't check the data type. just the number

console.log(5 == '5') //returns also true, not checking the data typr
console.log(5 != 5) //returns false 
console.log(5 != '5') //also returns false, cause it's false to claim number 5 is not equal to number 5, even tho one is string and other number
console.log(5 !== 5) //returns false as strict inequality
console.log(5 !== '5') //returns true , as one is string and other is number
